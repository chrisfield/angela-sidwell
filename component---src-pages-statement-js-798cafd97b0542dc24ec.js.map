Between the layers of the domestic, industrial or discarded, a seed will find sustenance to flourish, a bird seeks out a safe niche to nest and breed, and a fox winds in and out of quiet edges.\n    </p><p>\n      My work examines the relationships between human and non-human animals, and the blurring of spaces where urban environment meets nature. I am always hesitant to use the term “nature”, as it implies that there is a divide between us and it, and this question is at the heart of what inspires my practice.\n    </p><p>\n      My sculptures are fragmented as I am not seeking to capture a spirit or a moment in time, on the contrary – they are an invitation to the viewer, to move in and inhabit <em>their</em> world.\n    </p><p>\n      The fibres in paper clay allow me to stretch and tear, pushing the material as far as I can before it breaks, the rough edges hinting at a ragged and delicate life in the balance.
